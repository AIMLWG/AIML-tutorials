I will outline a few of its features as provided in the [first pages of its documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/whatisnumpy.html).\n",

    "Previously when discussing elementwise operations, we were really discussing a general concept of [broadcasting](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.broadcasting.html). In the most general sense, broadcasting encompases the fundamental concept of how NumPy treats operations between arrays of different sizes. In the case of arrays and floats/integers, this is the specific case of some array of some shape, and an array of shape `(1,)`.\n",

The long story short is that this dataset ranks if you're a credit risk based on a variety of factors. Ignoring the possible ethical concerns with this type of data, let's focus only on the numerical columns of this dataset and show a common use of broadcasting.\n",

    "From the above, note that `X - mu` performs the operation of subtracting `mu[0]` from the `0`th column in `X`, but for every row, and similarly for `mu[1]` and `mu[2]`. This process is much faster than using Python for loops because NumPy is calling **compiled libraries**, which use lower-level code like C++ or Assembly. You always want to use broadcasting and NumPy functions. They will always be faster and usually more efficient."
